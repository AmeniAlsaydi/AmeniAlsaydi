## Hi, I'm Ameni! 🧕🏽 !مرحبًا، أنا أماني 

I have spent the past year learning to code as an iOS Fellow at [Pursuit](https://www.pursuit.org/). I'm passionate about community and environmental health and now spend my time building iOS applications I believe can make an impact 🌎 and even have an app on the app store, [CareeView](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1517829055). I'm currently working on Renew, an application to ease the overwhelming but necessary process of recycling, coming soon 👀! 

Despite the progress I have made in the past year I realize there is so much more to learn. I'm excited to pursue that knowledge and aim to never stop learning.
